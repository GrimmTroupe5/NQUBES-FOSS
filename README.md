# NQUBES-FOSS

Software created a cloned application with defense (secure-isolation-focused) features, the cloned app will be fully isolated and will not connect to the main application, when you get a virus while carrying out activities in the cloned application, it only damages the cloned application, you could say the virus is remains contained within the cloned environment (stuck). 

I'm currently developt the original source code, even though the files are empty for now, update will be release after everything is completed, even if I publish it, there may still contain bugs or potential instability.
